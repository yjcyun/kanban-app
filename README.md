# Frontend Mentor - Kanban task management web app solution

![Preview](./preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Kanban task management web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- [x] Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- [x] Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- [x] Hide/show the board sidebar
- [x] Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- [x] Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- [x] Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
